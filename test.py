test=['To assist in evaluating the semantic similarity of texts under the conditions specified for Personal Financial Literacy, follow this structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Criteria\n- **Financial Behavior**: Focuses on actions and practices related to managing personal finances, such as saving, spending, investing, and budgeting.\n- **Financial Literacy**: Pertains to understanding financial concepts, principles, and tools necessary for making informed decisions about money.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Elements\nFor each condition, identify key elements that define the criteria:\n- **Financial Behavior**:\n  - Saving habits\n  - Spending patterns\n  - Investment strategies\n  - Budgeting techniques\n- **Financial Literacy**:\n  - Understanding of financial terms\n  - Knowledge of financial products\n  - Ability to interpret financial data\n  - Application of financial planning skills\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Sentence Pairs\nConsider two sentences (Sentence A and Sentence B) and compare them against the criteria identified in Steps 1 and 2.\n\n#### Example Sentence Pairs:\n1. "She saves a portion of her income every month." vs. "He invests in stocks regularly."\n2. "Understanding the interest rates helps in choosing the right loan." vs. "Calculating compound interest is crucial for savings growth."\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Semantic Similarity\nEvaluate the similarity based on the following:\n- **Content Relevance**: Does the content align with the criteria?\n- **Contextual Similarity**: Are the contexts of the sentences similar in relation to the criteria?\n\n### Step 5: Assign Scores\nAssign a score from 1 to 5 based on the evaluation:\n- **1**: Very dissimilar (e.g., one sentence discusses saving while the other discusses investing)\n- **2**: Moderately dissimilar (e.g., both discuss saving but in different scenarios)\n- **3**: Somewhat similar (e.g., both involve financial decision-making)\n- **4**: Moderately similar (e.g., both involve understanding financial concepts)\n- **5**: Very similar (e.g., both describe actions that directly impact financial health)\n\n### Step 6: Categorize Based on Conditions\n- **Financial Behavior**: Score for the first pair might be 4, for the second pair 3.\n- **Financial Literacy**: Score for the first pair might be 3, for the second pair 5.\n\n### Python List Representation\n```python\n[\'financial behavior: 4\', \'financial behavior: 3\', \'financial literacy: 3\']\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis structured approach allows an LLM agent to evaluate the semantic similarity of texts under different conditions in Personal Financial Literacy without requiring additional training or complex technologies like word embeddings. By systematically comparing sentences against defined criteria and assessing their relevance and context, accurate scores can be assigned efficiently.', 'To formulate a Chain of Thought for evaluating the semantic similarity (c-sts) in the context of Personal Financial Literacy, considering the aspects of \'financial behavior\' and \'financial literacy\', we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Context\n- **Objective**: Understand the specific context of each sentence pair related to personal financial literacy. Identify whether sentences relate to financial behavior, financial literacy, or both.\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Sentences\n- **Process**: Carefully read each sentence pair and categorize them based on their content:\n  - **Financial Behavior**: Sentences discussing actions, habits, decisions, or outcomes related to managing money.\n  - **Financial Literacy**: Sentences explaining concepts, principles, or skills related to understanding financial matters.\n  - **Overlap**: Sentences that might touch upon both financial behavior and financial literacy simultaneously.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Similarity\n- **Criteria**: For each category, assess the similarity in terms of meaning, intent, and relevance. Consider synonyms, related terms, and the overall message being conveyed.\n  - **Example Analysis**:\n    - Sentence 1: "Saving for retirement is crucial."\n    - Sentence 2: "It\'s important to plan for old age financially."\n    - **Similarity**: High, as both sentences emphasize the importance of saving or planning financially for future needs. **Score**: 4 (Very similar)\n    - **Category**: Financial Behavior\n\n### Step 4: Document the Evaluation\n- **Recording**: For each sentence pair, document the evaluation under its respective category (financial behavior, financial literacy, or overlap) along with the assigned score.\n  - **Example Recording**:\n    - Sentence Pair: ["Saving for retirement is crucial.", "It\'s important to plan for old age financially."]\n    - **Evaluation**: Financial Behavior, Score: 4\n\n### Step 5: Compile the Scores\n- **Table Construction**: Create a structured list summarizing the scores for all sentence pairs across both categories (\'financial behavior\' and \'financial literacy\').\n  - **Example Table**:\n    - [\'Financial Behavior: 4\', \'Financial Behavior: 3\', \'Financial Literacy: 5\', ...]\n\n### Step 6: Final Output\n- **Presentation**: Present the final scores in a Python list format as requested:\n  ```python\n  [\n      \'financial behavior: 4\',\n      \'financial behavior: 3\',\n      \'financial literacy: 5\',\n      ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Chain of Thought Summary:\n1. **Define Context**: Understand the task and the criteria for evaluation.\n2. **Sentence Categorization**: Break down sentences into financial behavior and financial literacy categories.\n3. **Similarity Analysis**: Evaluate the semantic similarity within each category.\n4. **Documentation**: Record evaluations systematically.\n5. **Compilation**: Summarize results in a structured list.\n6. **Output Presentation**: Deliver results in a Python list format.\n\nThis chain of thought provides a logical, step-by-step approach for an LLM agent to evaluate the semantic similarity of texts related to Personal Financial Literacy without requiring additional training or complex techniques like word embeddings.']

[We are working on Predefined Task Information Setting(PI, PII) and current designing Predefined Task Information Setting(PI, PIII)

We have used Stage I Task Setting Draft as the result and did an Example Case Testing. The result is shown in Example Case Testing Result

However, we have found the following problem after reviewing:

1. You should change the report format into: “perspectives, c-sts result” and do not give too many description in report
2.  You need to give a table to list all the score - the perspectives and you should also list a over all average similarity score at the end of the score table.

Please mortify the Stage I Task Setting Draft based on our reviewing result and the draft itself. Please give the whole changed result to me.
