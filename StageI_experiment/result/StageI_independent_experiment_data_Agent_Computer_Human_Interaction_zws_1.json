For example, 'Haptic Impact on Experience' might focus on how touch affects user engagement, 'Realism of Haptics' could be about the level of detail and authenticity in haptic feedback, and 'Haptic Technology Improvements' could refer to advancements in technology that enhance the haptic experience.\n\n### Step 2: Define Key Concepts\n- **Break Down Each Perspective**:\n  - **Haptic Impact on Experience**: Focus on elements like user engagement, emotional response, and interaction dynamics.\n  - **Realism of Haptics**: Consider factors such as tactile accuracy, sensory immersion, and feedback quality.\n  - **Haptic Technology Improvements**: Look at innovation, efficiency, integration capabilities, and user adaptability.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Sentence Pairs\n- **Sentence Pair Analysis**:\n  1. **Identify Core Messages**: Extract the main ideas or arguments within each sentence pair.\n  2. **Compare Themes**: Check if the sentences share common themes across the perspectives.\n  3. **Evaluate Consistency**: Assess if the sentences align with the expectations set by the chosen perspective.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Scores Based on Similarity\n- **Score Assignment**:\n  - **Very Dissimilar (1)**: Sentences have little to no overlap in themes or are clearly addressing different aspects.\n  - **Somewhat Dissimilar (2)**: Sentences share some common themes but are not closely related.\n  - **Neutral (3)**: Sentences address similar themes but do not necessarily reinforce each other.\n  - **Somewhat Similar (4)**: Sentences share a significant overlap in themes, reinforcing each other to some extent.\n  - **Very Similar (5)**: Sentences are closely aligned in their themes, providing strong reinforcement of each other.\n\n### Step 5: Compile Scores\n- **Final Scores Table**:\n  ```python\n  [\n      'Haptic Impact on Experience: ?',\n      'Realism of Haptics: ?',\n      'Haptic Technology Improvements: ?'\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Step 6: Review and Justify\n- **Explain Decisions**: For each score, provide a brief explanation justifying the choice based on the analysis performed in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n### Example Application\nSuppose we have two sentences:\n1. \"The enhanced haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement.\"\n2. \"Users report higher levels of immersion when using devices with advanced haptic technologies.\"\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Haptic Impact on Experience**: Both sentences discuss positive impacts on user engagement through haptic feedback.\n- **Realism of Haptics**: While not directly addressed, the improvement in engagement indirectly relates to the realism of haptic experiences.\n- **Haptic Technology Improvements**: Both sentences imply advancements in technology contributing to better haptic experiences.\n\n**Scores**:\n```python\n[\n    'Haptic Impact on Experience: 5',\n    'Realism of Haptics: 4',\n    'Haptic Technology Improvements: 5'\n]\n```\n\nThis approach ensures a systematic and logical evaluation of semantic similarity across multiple perspectives, without relying on pre-trained models or complex algorithms.", "Question_4": "To evaluate the semantic similarity of texts under different conditions (c-sts) related to the aspects of 'Adaptive Interface Responsiveness', 'Adaptive Interface Issues', and 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces', follow this structured chain of thought:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\n- **Read and Understand**: Carefully read through the text pairs you're assessing. Identify key phrases, terms, and concepts related to each perspective (Adaptive Interface Responsiveness, Adaptive Interface Issues, Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Criteria\n- **Adaptive Interface Responsiveness**: Look for descriptions of how interfaces adapt to user behavior, preferences, or environmental conditions. Consider factors like speed of adaptation, user feedback incorporation, and context awareness.\n- **Adaptive Interface Issues**: Identify any challenges or problems associated with adaptive interfaces. This could include issues with user confusion, interface instability, or compatibility problems.\n- **Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces**: Note what users expect from adaptive interfaces. This might include personalization options, ease of use, and accessibility features.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Textual Similarities\n- **Compare Phrases**: Compare the phrases used across the text pairs for each perspective. Look for synonyms, paraphrasing, and overlapping themes.\n- **Contextual Analysis**: Consider how the contexts of the texts influence their similarity. Are they discussing similar technologies, addressing similar user needs, or presenting similar challenges?\n\n### Step 4: Quantitative Assessment\n- **Score Allocation**: Assign a score based on the level of similarity identified in Steps 2 and 3. For example:\n    - **Very Dissimilar (1)**: If there is no overlap in key phrases, concepts, or issues.\n    - **Somewhat Dissimilar (2)**: If there is some overlap but significant differences in detail or context.\n    - **Moderately Similar (3)**: If there is clear overlap but some nuanced differences.\n    - **Very Similar (4)**: If the texts share many similarities in terms, concepts, and context.\n    - **Identical (5)**: If the texts are essentially duplicates or present identical information.\n\n### Step 5: Organize Scores\n- **List Scores**: Compile the scores into a list as requested: `['Adaptive Interface Responsiveness: ?', 'Adaptive Interface Issues: ?', 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces: ?']`. Replace '?' with the actual scores obtained from the analysis.\n\n### Example Output:\n```python\n['Adaptive Interface Responsiveness: 4',\n 'Adaptive Interface Issues: 3',\n 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces: 5']\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Consistency**: Ensure that the criteria for assigning scores is consistent across all text pairs.\n- **Documentation**: Keep notes on specific examples or phrases that influenced your scoring decisions for clarity and reproducibility.\n\nBy following this chain of thought, LLM agents can systematically evaluate the semantic similarity of texts under the specified conditions without requiring additional training or complex techniques like word embeddings.", "Question_5": "To evaluate the semantic similarity (c-sts) for different conditions related to Computer_Human_Interaction without the use of traditional training methods or technologies like word embeddings, an LLM could follow a structured analytical approach that leverages its understanding of language, context, and semantics. Here's a step-by-step chain of thought for an LLM to systematically evaluate the c-sts:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Criteria\n- **Efficiency of Multimodal Interaction**: Focuses on the ease, speed, and effectiveness of interactions involving multiple sensory inputs (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic).\n- **Multimodal Integration Issues**: Identifies challenges in combining different modalities effectively (e.g., misalignment of visual and auditory cues, difficulty in interpreting multimodal signals).\n- **Multimodal Interaction Improvements**: Suggests enhancements or solutions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal interactions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Sentence Pairs\nFor each sentence pair, the LLM should:\n- **Identify Relevant Aspects**: Determine if the sentences pertain to any of the three main criteria (efficiency, integration issues, or improvements).\n- **Extract Key Concepts**: Identify core ideas, modalities involved, and interaction contexts.\n- **Evaluate Contextual Relevance**: Assess how well the sentences align with the specific criterion they are supposed to address.\n\n### Step 3: Compare and Contrast\n- **Efficiency of Multimodal Interaction**: Compare the sentences on their ability to facilitate quick, effective, and smooth interactions across multiple modalities.\n- **Multimodal Integration Issues**: Contrast the sentences to highlight points where the integration of different modalities is problematic or confusing.\n- **Multimodal Interaction Improvements**: Evaluate suggestions for enhancements based on their potential impact on improving multimodal interaction experiences.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Similarity Scores\n- **Score Efficiency**: Assign a score based on the sentences' alignment with efficient multimodal interaction principles.\n- **Score Integration Issues**: Rate the severity and implications of identified integration problems.\n- **Score Improvements**: Grade the feasibility, impact, and innovation of proposed improvements.\n\n### Step 5: Compile Results\nAfter evaluating all sentence pairs under each criterion, compile the results into a structured format. For example:\n\n```python\nevaluation_results = [\n    'Efficiency of Multimodal Interaction: ?',\n    'Multimodal Integration Issues: ?',\n    'Multimodal Interaction Improvements: ?'\n]\n```\n\n### Example Evaluation\nAssuming an LLM has evaluated a set of sentence pairs and determined their relevance to the criteria, here\u2019s how the evaluation might look:\n\n```python\nevaluation_results = [\n    'Efficiency of Multimodal Interaction: 4',\n    'Multimodal Integration Issues: 2',\n    'Multimodal Interaction Improvements: 3'\n]\n```\n\nThis output indicates that, according to the LLM's analysis, the efficiency of interactions was generally high (score 4), there were some minor integration issues (score 2), and there were several promising suggestions for improvement (score 3).\n\nBy following this chain of thought, an LLM can systematically evaluate the semantic similarity across different conditions related to Computer_Human_Interaction without relying on traditional training or advanced linguistic tools."}, "Predefined_Task_Information_Setting_dict": {"Question_1": {"PI_C-STS Task Setting": "I am currently engaged in the task of evaluating the semantic similarity of texts under different conditions (c-sts), which requires us to assess the degree of similarity between texts based on various perspectives and provide corresponding similarity scores.

For example, 'Haptic Impact on Experience' might focus on how touch affects user engagement, 'Realism of Haptics' could be about the level of detail and authenticity in haptic feedback, and 'Haptic Technology Improvements' could refer to advancements in technology that enhance the haptic experience.\n\n### Step 2: Define Key Concepts\n- **Break Down Each Perspective**:\n  - **Haptic Impact on Experience**: Focus on elements like user engagement, emotional response, and interaction dynamics.\n  - **Realism of Haptics**: Consider factors such as tactile accuracy, sensory immersion, and feedback quality.\n  - **Haptic Technology Improvements**: Look at innovation, efficiency, integration capabilities, and user adaptability.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Sentence Pairs\n- **Sentence Pair Analysis**:\n  1. **Identify Core Messages**: Extract the main ideas or arguments within each sentence pair.\n  2. **Compare Themes**: Check if the sentences share common themes across the perspectives.\n  3. **Evaluate Consistency**: Assess if the sentences align with the expectations set by the chosen perspective.\n\n### Step 4: Assign Scores Based on Similarity\n- **Score Assignment**:\n  - **Very Dissimilar (1)**: Sentences have little to no overlap in themes or are clearly addressing different aspects.\n  - **Somewhat Dissimilar (2)**: Sentences share some common themes but are not closely related.\n  - **Neutral (3)**: Sentences address similar themes but do not necessarily reinforce each other.\n  - **Somewhat Similar (4)**: Sentences share a significant overlap in themes, reinforcing each other to some extent.\n  - **Very Similar (5)**: Sentences are closely aligned in their themes, providing strong reinforcement of each other.\n\n### Step 5: Compile Scores\n- **Final Scores Table**:\n  ```python\n  [\n      'Haptic Impact on Experience: ?',\n      'Realism of Haptics: ?',\n      'Haptic Technology Improvements: ?'\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Step 6: Review and Justify\n- **Explain Decisions**: For each score, provide a brief explanation justifying the choice based on the analysis performed in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n### Example Application\nSuppose we have two sentences:\n1. \"The enhanced haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement.\"\n2. \"Users report higher levels of immersion when using devices with advanced haptic technologies.\"\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Haptic Impact on Experience**: Both sentences discuss positive impacts on user engagement through haptic feedback.\n- **Realism of Haptics**: While not directly addressed, the improvement in engagement indirectly relates to the realism of haptic experiences.\n- **Haptic Technology Improvements**: Both sentences imply advancements in technology contributing to better haptic experiences.\n\n**Scores**:\n```python\n[\n    'Haptic Impact on Experience: 5',\n    'Realism of Haptics: 4',\n    'Haptic Technology Improvements: 5'\n]\n```\n\nThis approach ensures a systematic and logical evaluation of semantic similarity across multiple perspectives, without relying on pre-trained models or complex algorithms."], "Question_4": ["To evaluate the semantic similarity of texts under different conditions (c-sts) related to the aspects of 'Adaptive Interface Responsiveness', 'Adaptive Interface Issues', and 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces', follow this structured chain of thought:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\n- **Read and Understand**: Carefully read through the text pairs you're assessing. Identify key phrases, terms, and concepts related to each perspective (Adaptive Interface Responsiveness, Adaptive Interface Issues, Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Criteria\n- **Adaptive Interface Responsiveness**: Look for descriptions of how interfaces adapt to user behavior, preferences, or environmental conditions. Consider factors like speed of adaptation, user feedback incorporation, and context awareness.\n- **Adaptive Interface Issues**: Identify any challenges or problems associated with adaptive interfaces. This could include issues with user confusion, interface instability, or compatibility problems.\n- **Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces**: Note what users expect from adaptive interfaces. This might include personalization options, ease of use, and accessibility features.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Textual Similarities\n- **Compare Phrases**: Compare the phrases used across the text pairs for each perspective. Look for synonyms, paraphrasing, and overlapping themes.\n- **Contextual Analysis**: Consider how the contexts of the texts influence their similarity. Are they discussing similar technologies, addressing similar user needs, or presenting similar challenges?\n\n### Step 4: Quantitative Assessment\n- **Score Allocation**: Assign a score based on the level of similarity identified in Steps 2 and 3. For example:\n    - **Very Dissimilar (1)**: If there is no overlap in key phrases, concepts, or issues.\n    - **Somewhat Dissimilar (2)**: If there is some overlap but significant differences in detail or context.\n    - **Moderately Similar (3)**: If there is clear overlap but some nuanced differences.\n    - **Very Similar (4)**: If the texts share many similarities in terms, concepts, and context.\n    - **Identical (5)**: If the texts are essentially duplicates or present identical information.\n\n### Step 5: Organize Scores\n- **List Scores**: Compile the scores into a list as requested: `['Adaptive Interface Responsiveness: ?', 'Adaptive Interface Issues: ?', 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces: ?']`. Replace '?' with the actual scores obtained from the analysis.\n\n### Example Output:\n```python\n['Adaptive Interface Responsiveness: 4',\n 'Adaptive Interface Issues: 3',\n 'Desired Features in Adaptive Interfaces: 5']\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Consistency**: Ensure that the criteria for assigning scores is consistent across all text pairs.\n- **Documentation**: Keep notes on specific examples or phrases that influenced your scoring decisions for clarity and reproducibility.\n\nBy following this chain of thought, LLM agents can systematically evaluate the semantic similarity of texts under the specified conditions without requiring additional training or complex techniques like word embeddings."], "Question_5": ["To evaluate the semantic similarity (c-sts) for different conditions related to Computer_Human_Interaction without the use of traditional training methods or technologies like word embeddings, an LLM could follow a structured analytical approach that leverages its understanding of language, context, and semantics.
